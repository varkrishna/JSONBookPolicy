We use an analytics service to collect anonymous data about how our app is used. This information helps us understand user behavior, app usage patterns, and demographics. Analyzing this data enables us to improve our app and provide a better user experience.

Crash Reporting Service

We also utilize a crash reporting service to track and analyze app crashes. When the app crashes, crash reports are generated, including information such as device information, stack traces, and the time of the crash. This data is used to diagnose and fix app crashes to enhance the app's stability.

## How do we use your information?

We use the information collected through analytics and crash reporting services to:

Improve User Experience: Analyzing app usage patterns helps us understand how users interact with our app. This insight allows us to enhance features, optimize user interfaces, and tailor content to better meet the needs of our users.
Enhance App Performance: Crash reports provide valuable data on app stability and performance issues. By identifying and addressing crashes, we strive to ensure a smooth and reliable app experience for all users.
Bug Fixes and Updates: Data collected from crash reports assists us in identifying and prioritizing bugs and issues for resolution. This enables us to release timely updates and improvements to the app.
Service Optimization: Aggregated and anonymized data may be used to analyze broader trends and patterns, helping us make informed decisions about app development, marketing strategies, and future enhancements.

## How do we share your information?

We share anonymized or aggregated data that does not personally identify you with third parties for various purposes, including analytics, research, or other business purposes. 

## How do we protect your information?

Data Minimization: We collect and retain only the minimum amount of information necessary to provide our services and fulfill our stated purposes. We do not retain your information for longer than is necessary to achieve these purposes.
